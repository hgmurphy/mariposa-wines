    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>The Murphy Family is a fourth-generation farming family beginning with a small cattle operation in Calaveras County. Owner, Tom Murphy, began growing wine grapes twenty years ago, and since his start he dreamed of opening a winery. Five years ago, Tom’s dream came true, and Mariposa Wines opened. Mariposa Wines is located outside of their hometown Escalon, California on Mariposa Road. Mariposa Wines serves as an area for the surrounding community to gather and hold events. As well as a center to showcase local agriculture and the art of transforming grapes into wine..</p>
